# KoolKode Process Virtual Machine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/koolkode/process.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/koolkode/process)

Provides the building blocks for creation of virtual machines that allow for process execution. A process
is composed from nodes and transitions, each node has a specific behavior that determines process flow.

The basic concepts of the PVM (Process Virtual Machine) are heavily inspired by JBoss [jBPM](http://jbpm.jboss.org/)
and [Activiti](http://activiti.org/).
